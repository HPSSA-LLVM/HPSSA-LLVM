## Changes

- Change the running example to something intiutive. May be we can use the same example
	from the part that you show. Something the audience can deduce from seeing the code.
	
- Change the diff code slide, That slide is a bit verbose, we can show it later.

- What is Profile guided optimization (PGO) before Objective slides. 

- I can give the whole talk :). 

- Change the order of the slides and remove some slides that describe Tau placement, 
	hot path, cold path, thermal frontier etc. 

- Will change the CFG Diagrams and the IRs, Magnify glass effect, make the tau texts bigger.

- Don't put so much content for explaining the HPSSA implementation in LLVM, too verbose
	right now. Maybe we can use hierarchy diagrams if possible.
